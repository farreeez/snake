# Snake

## Description
This project is a basic snake game clone that I developed using Java and Swing to learn fundamental GUI programming. It also helped me understand game loop and logic coding principles.

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Java Swing

Make sure you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system, as well as the Java Swing library, which is typically included with the JDK.

### Executing program

* You can control the snake using the arrow keys.
